# End-effector-enhanced

This project features a **3D design of a U-shaped bracket**, originally created for mounting or structural support applications. The design was **improved** by increasing the overall **thickness** to provide more durability and strength during usage.

## 📌 Original Design

<img width="964" height="366" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b8348df-2533-4d5a-ac48-964603e55f03" />

The original bracket had a thinner profile which was more prone to flexing under load.

## 🛠️ Improvements Made

- Increased base and wall **thickness** for added structural integrity.
- Preserved original dimensions where possible to maintain compatibility.
